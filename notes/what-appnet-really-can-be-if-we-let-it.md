What App.net really can be (if we let it)
12 June 2012
---

You need to stop thinking that [App.net] is a Twitter clone right now, because it's not. Think of the 'alpha' in alpha.app.net as indicating not only that what we see is an alpha version of their web app (which is powered by the much tech blog ignored API) but an alpha model and example of one of numerous ways to consume the API's data. What needs to happen is that [App.net]'s API becomes a high quality, developer friendly, secure 'social network in a box', which developers can use to build applications whom all have 'first class citizen' access to the user's information, posts, messages, relationships, privacy settings etc.

### Users as a service

Developer accounts (or, API access) need to be 'users as a service', rather than 'just an API'. I think the reason people aren't going as crazy as they could be over this is that they don't realise what it actually is. Tech blogs have been promoting App.net as an alternative to Twitter (which it is, but that's only one small part), when it has the potential to become membership to a 'club' of high quality web communities. 

### Why App.net will succeed (or at least why I think it will)

It has been said by many people (and notably [Sam]) that App.net is not throwing a wide enough net. I disagree, I think the choice of targeting developers first is a good one - developers are early adopters by nature, and by (initially) making this a community of primarily tech people they are enlisting the best possible group to give quality feedback about the API. A great API will lead to great things being built on top of it, which will potentially lead to more widespread adoption. Dalton and his team are niching to win and my opinion is that they are doing it right.

### Introducing [Friendle.me]

This morning I upgraded from my backer account to a developer account on [App.net]. There are a few things I've been itching to build, but one particular idea really stood out: **Friendle**. 

Friendle will be a high quality social community, powered by the App.net API. It will be a way of keeping up with people you know and connect with on [App.net] powered services, you could think of it as a service which draws some ideas from [Facebook], [Google+] and [alpha.app.net]. For a much more detailed explanation, you can read [this blog post]. Right now I have just put a splash page up, but you can [register your interest] with your [App.net] account and be notified when an alpha version of Friendle is availble.
