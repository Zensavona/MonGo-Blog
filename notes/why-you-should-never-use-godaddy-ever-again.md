Why you should never use GoDaddy again
19 September 2012

Although this is ultimately my fault, because I had the thought in the back of my mind at the time, I happened to be on GoDaddy's site for something work related and had the "it won't happen to me" mentality at the time, so I quickly checked if an idea for a domain for my side-project was available because it popped to mind in that moment. It was... 

**"cool" I thought, and continued with my work.**

Now, 3 days later, I remembered that domain and went into my webhost's (not GoDaddy) control panel to register said domain and run into this...

> Error: xxxxxxxxx.com is already registered and is not available.

Oh, really you assholes? A quick whois search and I find this...

> Registered through: GoDaddy.com, LLC (http://www.godaddy.com)

When I search again for the domain on GoDaddy, they prompt me to buy it with their "Domain buying service", and pay the charges associated. I am not buying the domain out of principle. Go die.

I suppose there is nothing 'wrong' with this business practice, of analysing the user's interest in the domain and buying it if their algorithm thinks that you want it. But I certainly will never use their services again after this. Back to [domai.nr] for my domain hunting quests.
