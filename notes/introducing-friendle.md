Introducing Friendle
12 June 2012
---

I've been using [alpha.app.net] for the past few days and it has given me so many ideas as to how a social community should function. Particularly the way conversations and user relationships should be handled.

### Both Facebook and Twitters approach to handling user relationships are broken

Facebook's friend system does not scale well (hence the need for like pages, which in turn have their own set of problems), Twitter's follower system is better, but still not perfect. I think there can be a better solution, which is why I am building Friendle.

Friendle will be a high quality social community, powered by the App.net API. It will be a way of keeping up with people you know and connect with on [App.net] powered services, you could think of it as a service which draws some ideas from [Facebook], [Google+] and [alpha.app.net]. For a much more detailed explanation, you can read [this blog post]. Right now I have just put a splash page up, but you can [register your interest] with your [App.net] account and be notified when an alpha version of Friendle is availble.
