Blog
====

An extremely simple web blog application, written in Go. It uses markdown for notes (blog posts) and Moustache for templating.

Don't for a minute think that this is stable, completely working or secure in any way - I am building this purely as a personal learning exercise.

All of that said, if you see anything which can be done better or a problem which there is a cleaner approach to solving, please open an issue and let me know (or submit a pull request!)
