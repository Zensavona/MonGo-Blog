Blog [![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/Zensavona/MonGo-Blog/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/Zensavona/MonGo-Blog/latest)
====

An extremely simple web blog application, written in Go. It uses markdown for notes (blog posts) and Moustache for templating.

This draws nearly all it's functionality and stays consistent with my "Blog" application, the only real difference is that this will use MongoDB for storage, while Blog uses statically cached markdown files.


Don't for a minute think that this is stable, completely working or secure in any way - I am building this purely as a personal learning exercise.

All of that said, if you see anything which can be done better or a problem which there is a cleaner approach to solving, please open an issue and let me know (or submit a pull request!)
